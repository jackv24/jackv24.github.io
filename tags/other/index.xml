This custom graphics engine was written using C++ and OpenGL, utilising AIE&amp;rsquo;s Bootstrap, which includes a few extra things such as ImGui. The shaders shown below were written in GLSL.
This graphics engine supports static and animated models in OBJ and FBX format, though animations are only supported in FBX. Render targets are used to display the post-processing effects shown above.</description>
